_installer_bigpicturecallingcard_description=A configurable Wordpress Theme version of <a href="https://html5up.net/big-picture" target="_blank">HTML5UP Big Picture</a> template made for the internet by <a href="https://cog.dog/" target="_blank">Alan Levine</a>. It creates a simple, elegant calling card.
_installer_bigpicturecallingcard_authordescription=You can see a demo version at <a href="http://lab.cogdogblog.com/bigpicture/">http://lab.cogdogblog.com/bigpicture/</a>. The top/splash screen is configured in the Wordpress Customizer. The backdrop image is managed by the Header Background controls in the Customizer, which means you have an option of loading several images that can be set to appear at random on page load.  Subsequent sections as you scroll down (or use the automatic generated menu) are managed as separate posts. If the post has a featured image, it's layout will be with that image as a large background, with title and content in the boxes. The theme automatically alternates between left/right side content that animates as the page is scrolled into.
